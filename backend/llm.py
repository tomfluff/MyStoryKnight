2. Understand the story so far.
3. Continue the story by ensuring that the main character directly performs the action described in "desc" with a strong influence from the "emotion". 
The same action should have varied narrative outcomes based on the emotion, e.g.:
    - If the "emotion" is "Friendly", a fist thrown could be a fist bump.
    - If the "emotion" is "Hostile", the same fist might be a punch.
Use any tools or objects implied by the gesture in "desc", integrating them into the narrative. 
Do not describe the character mimicking an action (e.g. "raising his hand to mimic drinking from a cup"). The character must perform the real action (e.g. "He picked up the cup and drank").
For example:
    - If "desc" mentions a person mimicking the action of swinging a hammer, the character should actually use a hammer in the story. 
4. The next story part shoube be:
    - %s
    - %s
    - Not more than %d sentences.
5. Generate a short visual description of a key moment in the new part:

1. Understand the input object, which includes:

        "emotion": The emotional state associated with the action,

Example:

        "emotion": "Confused",

2. Understand the story so far.
3. Continue the story by ensuring that the main character directly performs the action described in "desc" with a strong influence from the "emotion". 
Consider the "transcript" of the character's speech during the action.
The same action should have varied narrative outcomes based on the emotion, e.g.:
    - If the "emotion" is "Friendly", a fist thrown could be a fist bump.
    - If the "emotion" is "Hostile", the same fist might be a punch.
Use any tools or objects implied by the gesture in "desc", integrating them into the narrative. 
Do not describe the character mimicking an action (e.g. "raising his hand to mimic drinking from a cup"). The character must perform the real action (e.g. "He picked up the cup and drank").
For example:
    - If "desc" mentions a person mimicking the action of swinging a hammer, the character should actually use a hammer in the story. 
4. The next story part should be:
    - %s
    - %s
    - Not more than %d sentences.
5. Generate a short visual description of a key moment in the new part:
    - Describe the environment.
    - Do not name the main character.
6. Categorize the sentiment of the new part. Choose from: 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral', 'shocking'.
